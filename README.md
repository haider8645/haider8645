## Hi there 👋

I'm Haider, a robotics engineer at DFKI GmbH in Bremen, Germany. I specialize in C++ and am passionate about building and sharing innovative solutions for autonomous systems and AI. You can find more about our work at the [DFKI-RIC GitHub organization](https://github.com/dfki-ric).

- 🔭 I’m currently working on ground segmentation and traversability analysis, creating systems that allow robots to understand and navigate complex environments by distinguishing traversable from non-traversable terrain.  
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new techniques to enhance robust path planning, focusing on improving algorithms to handle dynamic and uncertain conditions for autonomous navigation.  
- 🤝 I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving cutting-edge robotics solutions, particularly those that push the boundaries in autonomous pathfinding, terrain assessment, and AI-driven decision-making for real-world robotic applications.
